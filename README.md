Welcome to reactive-kinesis!

## Tag Requirements
Uses [sbt-dynver](https://github.com/dwijnand/sbt-dynver) for dynamic git based versioning.

See: https://github.com/dwijnand/sbt-dynver#tag-requirements
In order to be recognized by sbt-dynver, tags must begin with the lowercase letter 'v' followed by a digit.

If you're not seeing what you expect, then start with this:

`git tag -a v0.0.1 -m "Initial version tag for sbt-dynver"`
